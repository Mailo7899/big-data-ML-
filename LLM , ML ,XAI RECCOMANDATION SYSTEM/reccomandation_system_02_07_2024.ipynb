The first is generosity of table where what is put before you food wise reflects time, effort, attention and care. Memorable meals, hosts and foods all show a generosity of the table.What is harder to find is generosity of knowledge where a cook will give you their prize techniques, recipes and knowledge for no other reason then to spread knowledge and pleasure though it might dilute their &quot;brand&quot; or mystique. You know people who never let go of a prize recipe because it is too valuable, too precious; something to be passed on to generations.I am happy to say that this cookbook reflects both kinds of generosity. The Collective really tries to convey the table type of generosity by providing a lot of blurbs from members and clients. Trying to give the atmosphere of a cheese shop where you and the seller spend time establishing trust and tasting models one thin cheese slice at a time.This book displays the generosity of knowledge by providing ALL the recipes loved by customers of the Cheeseboard. I spent a fortune buying the Olive Provolone bread, zampanos and other heady bread goodness that could be bought every time I left home and returned. When I left Berkeley sometimes I would think back longingly to bread from the cheeseboard during my travels.Now to the technical aspects. The book is definitely designed for people who have had previous experience with baking though they do show some rudimentary things like the window pane for gluten development. Still I would say that this book is not for the beginner but someone already comfortable with the bread making process.It is not as technically exhaustive as Silverton's _Breads of La Brea Bakery_ or Rheinhart's _Baker's Apprentice_but it does provide basic ideas and recipes that are used.Layout --The layout is not as user friendly as I would like with clear break-out steps so it is highly recommended that you read the recipe before using because the movement of the eye is not broken with subheaders and lines.The color of the paper is cream with use of black and red typography. It is done as a paperback that with use will become the scratch and sniff type of cookbook easily. If you bake and collect consider getting two copies because one will get quite a beating.Recipes -Solid gold for those who know how to bake and have the necessary equipment, like a baking stone. For those who have no patience to spend DAYS doing a sourdough starter this is not the book for you. Also, if you are a newbie to baking bread use Reinhardt's _Baker's Apprentice_ as a way better introduction since this book assumes you know what tacky and elastic dough refers to.I recommend this book highly with its anecdotal style, generosity of knowledge for any baking collection especially, a collection specializing in the northern California food revolution. However, for those just starting the adventure of baking there are way better teaching books.\",\n          \"His books have been in my collection of favorites for years. I ordered this one months ago and have been reading a chapter once a week as an extra devotional. He uses scripture to parallel life experiences and balances it out with encouragement for all sorts of perils in this walk of faith we all take daily. This book is a pick me up when I have had a troubling day. Its a dash of salt when I have missed my communion with God on rushed days. You don't just sit down at an empty table with this book. WWW brings you to the table where he seats you next to Christ and you are in absolute communion with the Lord Most high. Great literature for anyone regardless of where their walk is with Christ.\",\n          \"This is a lovely, sensitive story about a lonely dog searching for a home and the friendless little red hen he loves and protects. The author tells the story from the dog's and the hen's points of view, displaying a keen understanding of animal behavior. Sensitive children will identify with the protagonists, and it is impossible to avoid caring deeply about the fate of the two friends as the reader is drawn into their world. The story is suspenseful without being too scary for young children, and also includes a valuable message about accepting those who are &quot;different.&quot; I loved this story as a youngster, and borrowed it dozens of times from my elementary school library. I just re-discovered it now at 36 years of age (I had assumed that it was out of print).

Arguing that the history of walking includes walking for pleasure as well as for political, aesthetic, and social meaning, Solnit focuses on the walkers whose everyday and extreme acts have shaped our culture, from philosophers to poets to mountaineers. She profiles some of the most significant walkers in history and fiction--from Wordsworth to Gary Snyder, from Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet to Andre Breton's Nadja--finding a profound relationship between walking and thinking and walking and culture. Solnit argues for the necessity of preserving the time and space in which to walk in our ever more car-dependent and accelerated world.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23403,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Janice Costa', 'Daina Manning']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"categories\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1374,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Electronic book']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bin_review/score2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","#Y:\\My Drive\\big data analytics\n","#/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/2024_BDA/data/Books_rating.csv\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","filepath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/2024_BDA/data/'\n","\n","df_cleaned_rating_unito2 = pd.read_csv(filepath+\"amazon_book_description.csv\")\n","df_cleaned_rating_unito2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#dt 50"],"metadata":{"id":"OChcIS2zMJvx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Importa la libreria pandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","# Specifica il percorso del file CSV\n","filepath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/2024_BDA/data/first_50_reviews.csv'\n","\n","# Leggi il file CSV specificando il separatore ';'\n","df_cleaned_rating_unito2 = pd.read_csv(filepath, delimiter=';')\n","\n","df_cleaned_rating_unito2\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0U_fj0v9MDrX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#dt 150"],"metadata":{"id":"7CjUM36sMLHc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Importa la libreria pandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","# Specifica il percorso del file CSV\n","filepath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/2024_BDA/data/updated_reviews_150.csv'\n","\n","# Leggi il file CSV specificando il separatore ';'\n","df_cleaned_rating_unito2 = pd.read_csv(filepath, delimiter=';')\n","\n","df_cleaned_rating_unito2\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"_DDsoc2bMF3_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719928646366,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4289,"user":{"displayName":"Andrea Millone","userId":"02482753384277174057"}},"outputId":"ec64fb8e-f4e2-4cb8-e211-fc08c78037cc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive;

It's easy to see where he has picked up a lot of the material for his other books. I've passed through Portland a couple of times, however, the only thing I've ever done is gas up and stop for some fast-food. Every girl I've met from Portland was hot. It's a place I'd like to explore, especially after reading this book. I did live in Seattle for 6 months, and did some exploring. There is a lot of history in the great northwestern United States. As for the sleazy strip clubs and such; I feel they cheapen an area, and give it an undesirable atmosphere. Chuck never tries to sweeten the pot. He goes for the guts, which I find 'fresh' and compelling. Like another reviewer stated--the Chamber of Commerce wouldn't like potential citizens of Portland to use this book as a guide to the city. I for one would.\",\n          \"I am a big fan of this series.Not this time. Basically, this book is all about how our main character wants to get engaged to her- now - long term boyfriend. Fine - except that he never asks and this, in turn, just keeps freaking her out.So, instead of either \\\"sucking it up\\\" and moving on - she keeps expecting him to pop the question - at every turn and I mean at every turn. Basically, the author ends up making our heroine so pathetic that she becomes this complete turnoff.Every page and every paragraph includes the words: \\\"I know he is going to ask today\\\".... and this becomes so tedious. You want to scream \\\"Either ask him or move on\\\" just please put us out of our misery.I did not enjoy this book. The main character was wishy-washy and portrayed as a victim (if I don't get engaged I am nobody). There was no fun in reading this book for me and let's not even talk about the total lack of humour here.Pass on this one - please.\",\n          \"This is a very nice book! I used it to increase the SQL level of my employees. We did two puzzles a week, and compared our answers. And it sure helped. But there are some buts in this story. First, the puzzles are not always defined well, so you do not know what to do before you see the discussion in the answer part. Second, a lot of the solutions are not very good. Whenever I found a better one, I mailed Joe Celko. Every time he replied to me (very nice!) that somebody else also pointed it out and that there were even better solutions that mine. This means that the solutions are not always that good in the book. But still, it has alo of good brainteasers. But try them first yourself before looking to the answers as your answer could be better.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating_mean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5308052296760852,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4560,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.74468085106383,\n          4.911373707533235,\n          4.363086232980333\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_count_binary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26421,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Popular and portable, The Paris Mapguide-now in its second edition-contains everything visitors need to know to enjoy themselves in, get the best out of, and find their way around Paris.
